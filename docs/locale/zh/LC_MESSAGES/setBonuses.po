"If any of the slots defined in this section are blocked (due to the "
"character’s body not supporting clothing in these slots), then the slot "
"is counted as being equipped with an item of clothing from this set. For "
"example, as the leg slot is defined in this section, a character with a "
"taur’s body (which is therefore blocked from wearing leg clothing) would "
"have the ``numberRequiredForCompleteSet`` reduced by 1. It’s usually best"
" to fill out this section with each slot that can be fitted with an item "
"of this set’s clothing. As this set only has 1 item in it, this section "
"does nothing (as an item set can only ever be activated with at least 1 "
"item of clothing/weapon equipped), and is just for demonstrative "
"purposes."
