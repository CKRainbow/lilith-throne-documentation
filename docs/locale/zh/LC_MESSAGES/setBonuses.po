"If any of the slots defined in this section are blocked (due to the "
"character’s body not supporting clothing in these slots), then the slot "
"is counted as being equipped with an item of clothing from this set. For "
"example, as the leg slot is defined in this section, a character with a "
"taur’s body (which is therefore blocked from wearing leg clothing) would "
"have the ``numberRequiredForCompleteSet`` reduced by 1. It’s usually best"
" to fill out this section with each slot that can be fitted with an item "
"of this set’s clothing. As this set only has 1 item in it, this section "
"does nothing (as an item set can only ever be activated with at least 1 "
"item of clothing/weapon equipped), and is just for demonstrative "
"purposes."
msgstr "如果在这一部分中定义的栏位被禁用(由于角色的身体不支持在这些栏位中装备衣物)，那么栏位会被视作已经装备了该套装所需的衣物。例如，腿部栏位在该部分中定义，那么当角色拥有四足下肢时(会导致无法穿着腿部衣物)，所需的 ``numberRequiredForCompleteSet`` 就会减少1。通常最好在该部分中定义所有该套装加成可能会用到的栏位。如果该套装只由一件物品组成，那么这一部分将不会生效(因为物品套装必须至少装备一件衣物/武器)，仅用于演示目的。"
